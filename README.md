Application to manage a company's employee database


About:
This application allows an employer to keep track of all their employees, their department, managers, and salary.

Description:
The application allows the user pull up employees by their name, department, or manager depending on what information they need.


Issues: too many. Im sure that with more time I would be able to get the thing going right, but for now this is it.


Success: I had success in creating a bunch of files and getting the initial menu to come up.
